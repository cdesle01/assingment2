    <h4 style="text-align: center">Walking</h4>

<img src="dog.jpg">

    <p style="font-size: 20px">Whether it be due to a busy schedule, or your dog’s insatiable appetite
        for walks, we’ve go your back. Customize your dog’s walk, the time,
        length, and whether it be with some of the other dogs we walk or solo!
        If you have a usual
        walk you take them on, you can let us know to stick with your schedule,
        or we can take them on one of our many pre-determined routes! You can
        drop them off at our facility or we can come pick them up, with or without a leash, whatever
        works for you. </p>

    <h4 style="text-align: center">Day Care</h4>

    <img src="2dogs.jpg">

    <p style="font-size: 20px">Are you busy all day and want somebody to keep your furry friend company?
        We offer multiple Day Care services, either at your own home or at our
        facility! The choice is up to you if you want them home with one of our
        employees or at our Day Care center with the other dogs we take care
        of. With
        either option, you can customize your dog’s schedule with walks, eating
        times, and can even leave some of their favorite toys with them. At the
        end of the day, come pick up your friend at the  time you
        specified! </p>

    <img src="sleep.jpg">

    <p style="font-size: 20px">Going out of town for an extended period of time? No worries, our Day
        Care also extends into overnight stays. Feel free to leave any toys
        that would make our facility feel more like home, but everything else
        comes included! Unless instructed otherwise, we will provide your dog
        with our top of the line food and care. Your dog will always be taken
        care of, no matter the time. Just let us know when you will be coming
        back to pick them up and never have another worry, enjoy your time
        off!</p>
